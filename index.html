                    My eyes are closed and sleeping, my willing hands are still,<br/>
                    The one who worked so hard for you, is resting at god's will,<br/>
                    The total love I gave you, I hope will stay in mind,<br/>
                    The beautiful memories you gave me, I cannot leave behind.<br/>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I told you not to shed a tear, and also not to cry,<br/>
                    But then I wrote this ode to you, oh why? Oh why? Oh why,<br/>
                    I suppose I left a bit to early, my life force not quite spent,<br/>
                    That's why I hid my wallet, I still owe two weeks rent.<br/>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If all this seems intense to you? This surely is not right,<br/>
                    Why am I in this wooden box, I should be on a campsite?<br/>
                    I hope I brought you laughter and you are laughing still,<br/>
                    Cos I never found the answer on why they fire at will?

                    I could have gone around the world, the sound of music said so,<br/>
                    But now I've found a better place, that place we all must go,<br/>
                    I hope I've made a slight impact and my life was not in vain,<br/>
                    And sometime in the future a kind person will mention my name.<br/>

                    I was proud to be a royal marine and served on many a coast,<br/>
                    But now I have to march away, as the bugler sounds last post,<br/>
                    I hope there are some bootnecks here, their thirst i'm sure unbound,<br/>
                    They've heard that stollery's gone now and he's coughed up for a round.<br/>

                    I've had a really good life and done so many things,<br/>
                    I found a life long partner, after exchanging wedding rings,<br/>
                    I've seen my two sons prosper, of both i'm very proud,<br/>
                    With lovely wives beside them, they stand out in a crowd.

                  My story is about the time before, during and after joining the Royal Marines at the age of 17 and is full of 
                  little bytes of my history and how I was affected by the people who touched my life, sometimes in a good way 
                  and sometimes in a bad way. The book is about my recollections of the times I lived in.

                    Thank you for all the gifts you've given me: my intelligence, sense of humor, drive to win, love for family, and memories. I know you're not religious, and I've followed in your footsteps. However, I am a scientist, and I've explored eastern martial arts. Physics dictates that energy cannot be destroyed, it can only change state. Exploring energy and ki, and living with your vivacity, I know the power you had.

                  <p>
                    This power isn't gone, it lives on, just in a different form. I'm lucky to carry a small portion of it with me.
